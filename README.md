**I'm Chris Patterson 🧑‍💻**

I've grown up with computers. I even still have my award certificate from National Computer Camp, back when those were a thing. I have been doing full-stack web development since before IE5 was released, and have extensive experience as an individual contributor and as a people leader in a wide variety of industries.

I feel strongly about finding ways to collaborate and share knowledge with others. I've consistently been involved in mentoring interested co-workers (even outside of my immediate team) - from being an informal resource for questions, to documenting design and development patterns to facilitate future development and maintenance efforts, to more-formal means like code reviews.

I'm a passionate believer in the ability of technology to precipitate change, and enjoy working with smart people to ensure those changes remain solidly in the "plus" column. Currently, that's at <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/">Zendesk</a>.
