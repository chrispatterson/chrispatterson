**I'm Chris Patterson 🧑‍💻**

I'm an experienced and motivated software engineer and technical manager with a track record delivering impactful projects and also of growing effective teams capable of delivering high quality software. I've worked as an individual contributor and as a people leader in a wide variety of industries. 

I feel strongly about finding ways to collaborate and share knowledge with others. From being an informal resource for questions; to documenting design and development patterns to facilitate future development and maintenance efforts; to more-formal means like code reviews — I've consistently been involved in mentoring interested co-workers, even those outside of my immediate team.

I'm a passionate believer in the ability of technology to precipitate change, and enjoy working with smart people to ensure those changes remain solidly in the "plus" column.
